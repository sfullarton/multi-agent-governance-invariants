Agent
A bounded cognitive process capable of producing outputs and invoking tools, operating under explicit constraints.

Auditability
The ability for a human or authorised authority to reconstruct, inspect, and explain agent behaviour after the fact.

Coupling
Dependence of one agent’s internal reasoning on another agent’s internal state beyond governed message exchange.

Domain (Interaction Domain)
A formally defined mode of agent interaction (e.g. isolated, coordinated, synchronised) with explicit rules and transitions.

Drift
Gradual divergence of behaviour from intended bounds due to feedback, reinforcement, or environmental interaction.

Envelope
The effective constraint set under which an agent or group operates (permissions, time bounds, domains, policies).

Governance Authority
The authorised entity or system responsible for defining, modifying, and approving agent constraints and relationships.

Isolation
An interaction domain in which an agent operates without dependence on other agents’ internal states.

Synchrony
A temporary, explicitly governed condition in which multiple agents operate under aligned constraints to accelerate convergence.

Tool Invocation
Any outbound interaction from an agent to an external system or capability.

Temporal Boundedness
A constraint requiring that agent execution occurs within a defined time window with enforced termination or reset.
